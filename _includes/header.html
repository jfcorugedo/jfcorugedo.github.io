        I'm also an agile believer. It is not easy, specially in big companies, but I found that with focus on delivery working software (software that somebody needs) and being able to adapt your plans you can achive great things. The rest of the values are derived from these two: simplicity, interactions over tools, trust, etc...

        I really like working in self-sufficient, autonomous agile teams. Working together, building together, learning together!

        In my spare time I really enjoy spending time with my seven children. I love playing board games (my favourite is Game of Thrones) and watching TV series.
        <br>
        What else can I say: my life is full of hazzle an buzzle!
